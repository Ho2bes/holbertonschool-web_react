# TypeScript Project

This repository contains the solutions for a **TypeScript** project. The project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## üìù Project Overview

**TypeScript** enhances JavaScript by adding static types, which allows for better tooling, improved refactoring, and easier bug detection during development. This project covers the essential features of TypeScript, including types, interfaces, classes, and modules, and explores how TypeScript integrates with existing JavaScript projects.

### Key Concepts:
- **Static Typing**: Enforcing types in your code for variables, functions, and object structures.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Defining custom types and interfaces for better structure and clarity in your code.
- **Classes**: Implementing object-oriented programming principles in TypeScript using classes.
- **Modules**: Organizing and importing/exporting code across multiple files.
- **Compilation**: Transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`).

### Skills Gained:
- Writing TypeScript code and compiling it into JavaScript.
- Structuring and enforcing type safety in JavaScript code.
- Using advanced TypeScript features like generics, enums, and decorators.
- Integrating TypeScript into existing JavaScript applications.
